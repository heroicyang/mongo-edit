/**
 * Definition of the different environments
 *
 * 'node server.js' to launch in the default ('development') environment
 * 'NODE_ENV theEnv node server.js' to launch in environment 'theEnv'
 *
 * You can add as many environments as you want, as long as
 * the exported config object contains the following properties:
 *   * templatesDir: the directory holding the templates (you shouldn't need to change this)
 *   * pagination: object holding the two parameters (resultsPerPage and pagesAroundCurrent)
 *                 for the pagination (you shouldn't need to change this either)
 *   * svPort: the port on which the Express server will be launched
 *   * trustProxy: set it to true if you are running behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx.
 *                 That should be the case if you use Mongo Edit with your production database
 *                 on a server accessible from the outside (the best and easiest is to secure
 *                 all calls to Mongo Edit by a Basic Auth over SSL).
 *   * db: object holding all the information necessary to connect to your Mongo database:
 *           * host: host on which the database runs (localhost if you run Mongo Edit on the same server as the Mongo instance)
 *           * port: port on which the Mongo instance accepts connections
 *           * name: name of the database to use
 *           * username, password (Optional): if specified, authenticate as the corresponding user
 *                                            if not specified, don't (in that case, Mongo Edit
 *                                            won't work if the Mongo daemon was launched with the --auth option)
